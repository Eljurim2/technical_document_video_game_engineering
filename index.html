      Introduction to Game Engineering
    </header>

    <p> This course requires a lot of patience and dedication and in this
       tutorial you will be learning about a lot of interesting elements and
        components which you have been wondering till now, about how games are
         developed and engineered.</p>

    <p> This is the tutorial which will give you a detailed overview of all
       the internal architecture and components required for
        Game development. </p>

  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="what_is_a_video_game">
    <header>
      What is a Video Game?
    </header>

    <p> A video game can be defined as a game that runs on electronic devices
       which involves humans interacting with a user interface(UI) for
        generating visual responses on any video device like TV screen or
         computer monitor. This electronic game when played by a user,
          deals with a set of graphics, images or even audio to make the
           game more interactive. </p>

    <p> In simple words, video games are the digital entertainment
       platform (which is a form of software) that humans "play" via a
        computer, TV, smart phones, tablets or other gaming consoles.
         The word video in video game was a traditional add-on which came
          into existence when people used raster display device
           (still used in some places), but after the 20th century,
            this term was used for any type of display device which had the
             capability to produce two- or three-dimensional images/videos.</p>

  </section>

<section class="main-section" id="how_to_develop_a_good_game">
  <header> How to Develop a Good Game? </header>

  <p> Becoming a good Game developer needs a lot of practice,
     working on your ideas and a step by step approach.</p>
  <p> First step, is to come up with a plan/blueprint of the game.
     Games that doesn't follow proper development methodologies
      suffer from issues like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Time taken for development is more.</li>
    <li>Runs over budget.</li>
    <li>Tends to be unreasonably more buggy.</li>
  </ul>

<p>
So, an advice for the new game developers, before proceeding with designing
and coding the game, mend a clear goal and figure out what your game needs.
This phase of game development is called Requirement capture or Planning phase.
 You can also use formalized languages like Unified Modeling Language (UML),
(which we will discuss in details in our later chapter).
In the "Requirement capture" or "planning phase", game developers can use case
 diagrams, for quickly collecting the insights about the requirements
  (e.g. how many designers, coders, testers required or developing
   tools needed - Game Engine, Animation tools and other modeling tools
    along with the game play or story line or objectives and levels of game)
     to effectively manage and successfully complete your game development.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="game_engineering_team_management">
  <header> Game Engineering Team Management </header>

  <p>There are certain challenges which your developing team will have
     to face (if you are not developing games alone).
      Some of the issues which you or the team members may face are: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Every day new features and tools are released online and your
       team members will have to manage and upgrade their skills.</li>
    <li>There may be internal dispute or personal issues which your
       team manager should tactfully manage.</li>
    <li>Good tester(s) should have to be hired to make your game bug-free
       or else your game may not achieve the considerable popularity
        or even meet your set target.</li>
  </ul>

<p> So for that the project manager should choose proper and skilled designers,
   developers and testers to make the team work with coordination. </p>

</section>

<section class="main-section" id="architecture_of_a_game">
  <header> Architecture of a Game</header>

  <p>The architecture and structure of a game is similar to that of a software.
   But it does have some additional components which makes it different
    from a software. Every game has the following components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Graphics Engine</li>
    <li>Sound/Audio Engine</li>
    <li>Rendering & Vision-Input Engine</li>
    <li>I/O Devices (like, Mouse, keyboard, speaker, monitor etc)</li>
    <li>DLL files and Drivers/Device APIs</li>
  </ul>

  <p> All these above mentioned components combine together to make a game
     playable to its full extent. Before discussing each of them,
      let's just clear what an engine is. Engines are the
       self-processing component(s) of a complete process that are driving
        automatically behind the original process.</p>
  </section>

<section class="main-section" id="graphics_engine">
  <header> Graphics Engine</header>
  <p>A graphic engine is a software which in association with an application
     program helps to draw graphics on your computer's display device.</p>

  <p>The word engine in the computer field refers to a software which helps
     performing some definite type of processing on programs,
      such as text-to-speech engine, a database engine,
      a layout engine and a graphics engine. Graphics engine helps to make
       your game's graphics better by increasing the resolution and increasing
        the number of pixels per unit area. This engine also makes your
         game's scenes clear and run smooth.</p>
    </section>

<section class="main-section" id="sound/audio_engine">
  <header>Sound/Audio Engine</header>

  <p>The audio/sound engine is the component that consists of algorithms
     for dealing with sound and in-built programs are written into it to
      handle the sound effects embedded in the game. It has the capability
       to perform calculations using the CPU, or on any dedicated
        ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit).
       Abstraction APIs, such as Open-AL, SDL Audio, X-Audio 2, Web Audio, etc.
        can be available within this engine.</p>
  </section>

<section class="main-section" id="rendering_and_vision-input_engine">
  <header> Rendering and Vision-Input Engine</header>

  <p>The rendering engine along with vision input system produces 3D animated
     graphics, using different techniques, like rasterization and ray-tracing.
      Being programmed and compiled to be executed on any CPU or
       GPU straightforwardly, majority of rendering engines are developed upon
        one or more rendering APIs like Direct3D and/or OpenGL that offers
       a software abstraction layer for the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).</p>
  <p>Low-level libraries like DirectX or OpenGL are popularly incorporated
     in games because they supply the hardware-independent access to different
      computer hardware. These hardware devices can be input devices like mouse,
   keyboard, and joystick; network devices like NIC and also to sound cards.</p>

  </section>

<section class="main-section" id="i/o_devices">
  <header> I/O Devices</header>

  <p>The devices which are used for inputting the data and the programs
     in the computer are known as Input Devices. Input device can read data
      and convert them to a form that a computer can use. Output Devices
       can generate the finished product of machine processing into a form
        usable/readable by humans. For a game, there should have to be a strong
         interaction between the user and the game he/she is playing.
       So for this the peripheral devices like mouse, keyboard, joysticks
        and monitors play a major role to make the game interactive.</p>
  </section>

<section class="main-section" id="dll_files_and_drivers/device_apis">
  <header> DLL Files and Drivers/Device APIs</header>

  <p>A DLL (Dynamic Link Library) file, is a type of file which includes
     instructions written in the form of programs which can be called or used
      by other programs for performing certain tasks. In this manner,
       different programs can share the abilities and characteristics
        that have been programmed into a single file.</p>
  <p>These system level files play a supporting role to build the architecture
     of the game and help to make it perform well. You might have noticed that,
      if you have installed a game which you want to play and you click
       the executable(.exe file) to run the game, and just before starting
        of the game, an error message pops up, with a message:</p>

         <code>"particular_dll_name.dll is missing".</code>

    <p>  These files are the supporting files that your system should
       have to make the game work.</p>

    <p>Again, a device API can be defined as
       API (Application Programming Interface) which lets the developers
        to create any application which can ultimately interact with hardware
         devices plugged or installed with your system. A device API normally
          provides end users to employ their plugged or associated hardware
           for interacting with the system. Majority of the games (popular)
            need these device drivers and APIs to make the game work with
             all its components running successfully.</p>
      <p>These five components make the architecture of a game both
         internally as well as externally.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="list_of_all_game_genres">
  <header> List of all Game Genres</header>

  <p>Here we have listed the main genres when it comes to categorising games.</p>

  <ul>
    <li> Action Games</li>
    <li> Adventure Games</li>
    <li> Role-Playing Games</li>
    <li> Simulation Games</li>
    <li> Strategy Games</li>
    <li> Sport Games</li>
    <li> Scientific and Educational Games</li>
  </ul>

  </section>

<section class="main-section" id="benefits_of_understanding_the_genre_of_game">
<header> Benfefits of Understanding the Genre of Game</header>

<p>It is very crucial to understand the genre of the game before starting
   with game development. If you are working for some client for Game
    development project, try to understand the genre of the game that your
     client has in mind, it will help you with following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Design the theme of your Game. An adventure game may look good with
     a forest backdrop, while a game being designed for school kids would
      look good with colorful backdrop etc.</li>
  <li>Game sounds also depends upon the genre of the game.</li>
  <li>Use of blood and violence in the game is only adviced for Action games
     for 18+ age group players.</li>
</ul>

<section class="main-section" id="adding_a_c#_script_to_unity_game_project">
  <header>Adding a C# Script to Unity Game Project</header>
  <p>Of course, having objects that don't move in our game doesn't really
     make our game interesting. So, let's understand how Unity C# Script
      can be used to move the game objects, and from there on
       we'll move to Rigidbodies.</p>

    <p>First, of all, let's create a script. To do so,</p>
    <code>right click in the Assets area, and go to Create → C# Script.</code>
    <p>This will create a new file, with the default name NewBehaviourScript.
       Rename the script to Movement, and press Enter. This will create a new
        script with name Movement in the Assets section. Double click on it
         to open it, and let's see what happens. Don't type anything
          in this script for now.</p>

    <code> public class Movement : MonoBehaviour {<br>
       void Start(){

       }
      void Update() {

       }
    } </code>

    <p>Since we're now moving into scripting, let me take a few moments to
       mention that Unity refers to objects in a scene as gameObjects.
        So, from this point forward, we will refer to the used objects
         in the scene as gameObjects. Mr. Star will now be referred to
          as a gameObject instead of an object.</p>
    <p>You will notice that the script that we just created, comes with two
       pre-defined methods, and that your script automatically inherits
        from a base class called <em>MonoBehaviour</em>. Let's go through these
         one by one and try to understand what they mean.</p>
    </section>

<section class="main-section" id="monobehaviour">
  <header> MonoBehaviour</header>
  <p>This is the base class that all scripts inherit basic properties
     from, in Unity. This class defines and provides a lot of useful values,
      methods and properties which you can use in your script, saving you a
       lot of hassle. For example, MonoBehaviour contains definitions for
        the position of a gameObject </p>
  <code> gameObject.transform.position.x/y/z </code>
  <p>meaning you can use these values directly instead of having to define them.</p>
  <p>You generally shouldn't get rid of the inheritance declaration,
   since most of the time you'll need the stuff this parent class provides,
 to get your work done. MonoBehaviour also contains the definition for
  the <em>Start()</em> and <em>Update()</em> methods, which we will explain up ahead.</p>

  </section>

<section class="main-section" id="start()_method">
  <header> Start() Method</header>

  <p>This method is run by the script once, at the very beginning of when
     the gameObject is initialized and is enabled. This means that this method
      is run as soon as an object becomes active. If an object is already
     active when the scene is opened, the initialization and enabling process
   are considered simultaneous. This method is very useful when you need
    to declare components or set values. For example, you can use the Start
   method to set the initial value of a gun's bullet count. You can also
    use it to access other components attached to any gameObject,
     as we'll see later on.</p>
     <p>Check out the below code example, and do go through the comments to understand it.</p>

     <code> //Let's consider this script to be attached to a gun
            //in the game. the gun has an initial number of bullets
            //Whenever it's spawned, and it has a Rigidbody2D for
            //dealing with it's physics. Try to come back to this picture
            //When you've understood Rigidbodies so you can get a better
            //understanding of what's going on here.

            public int bulletCount;
            //Declaring the bulletCount variable.<br>
            <br>
            private Rigidbody2D gunBody;
            //Declaring a Rigidbody2D instance.<br>
            <br>
            void Start(){<br>

          bulletCount = 50;
          //Whenever a gun is initialized, set it's starting
          //bullet count to 50.<br>

        gunBody = GetComponent Rigidbody2D();
        //Give gunBody an actual Rigidbody2D by looking
        //for a Rigidbody2D attached to the gun.
      }
      </code>
      </section>

<section class="main-section" id="update()_method">
  <header> Update() Method</header>

  <p>This method is called 60 times per second by Unity
     (Or, 60 frames per second). It's where the main action of your code
      usually happens. For example, detecting input, adding forces,
       adding score, spawning enemies or bullets etc.</p>
  <code>
    //Update is called once per frame
    void Update(){
    <br>
    if(input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
    //if the left mouse button is pressed...<br>
    <br>
    Instantiate(bullet);
    //Create a bullet sprite. We'll be dealing with
    //This later on.
  }
  </code>

  <p> There are plenty of other pre-defined methods that MonoBehaviour
     class gives us. You can actually find a list of these methods in
      the Unity Documentation. They're for a variety of purposes,
       but for the time being, and for simplicity's sake,
       we will stick to just these two methods and the ones
        that we define on our own.</p>
